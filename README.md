<p>This extension brings Visual Studio Code language support to the <a href="https://radishpl.com/">Radish programming language</a>.</p>
<h3>Features:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Basic tokenizing - the RLE will tokenize basic keywords such as 'dig' without needing any semantic highlighting permissions.</li>
    <li>Semantic tokenizing - using a highly accurate dependency system, the RLE will tokenize special values such as functions and classes if given permission.</li>
    <li>Autocomplete - accurate autocomplete for variables, keywords, and object properties.</li>
    <li>Function signatures - the RLE provides information about functions and their parameters as you write code to call them.</li>
    <li>Hover descriptions - hover over any variable or property to find info about its value and/or documentation.</li>
    <li>Error reporting - the RLE provides necessary info for syntax errors, code after breaking statements, and unused variables.</li>
</ul>
